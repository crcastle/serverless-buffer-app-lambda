# Serverless Buffer App Lambda Functions

This repo supports the [Serverless Buffer App GUI](https://github.com/crcastle/serverless-buffer-app-gui).  It contains the [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) functions that the GUI calls.

You could use this by itself, but you'd have to figure out your own way to make the HTTP API requests.
